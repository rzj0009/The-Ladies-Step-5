## The Ladies Group Project Step 5 
####Comparsion of time points 12 and 18 in each replicate population and Comparison of Mean Allele Frequencies over all time points in each replicate population


###Goals
#####The overall goal of this project was to identify regions of the yeast genome with substantial genetic change over time. Because we were given the last time points, we collected data from other groups with earlier time points to show change in allele frequencies over the entire experiment.

####Sample IDs used in analysis (Rep=Replicate Population, TP=Time Point)

####Stats stuff from Keah? If we can ever figure out how to interpret the output of the stats program.

####Pipeline
Data extraction Stuff from Keah 

Manhattan Plot stuff from Sayma

Time Series stuff from Jessie 


####Group Member Contributions:
######Keah was responsible for extracting data and passing it on to the appropriate group members and statictical calculations
######Jessie was responsible for time series plot and coordinating with other groups
######Sayma was responsible for generating Manhattan plots for each replicate
######Jennifer wsa responsible for troubleshooting R codes and repository building in Github
